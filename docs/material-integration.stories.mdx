# Material UI integration
This page shows how an input and a preview component with Material UI can be built and connected to this component. It's possible to put everything into one file.

First the imports need to be declared.

<Source language='tsx' code={`
import * as React from 'react';
import { DSVImport as Import, ColumnsType, useDSVImport } from 'react-dsv-import';
`} />
